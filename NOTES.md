ML
network protocol clients (not just HTTP)
cryptography
other-that-C extensions (i.e. in Rust, Zig, Go...) along with pre-compiled builds

ML
- torch.rb
- numruby
- faiss
Network
- net-ssh
- ruby-mqtt
- ruby-netsnmp (I'm the maintainer, so free add alert)
Cryptography
- bcrypt_pbkdf
- Everything RubyCrypto

Aspecial mention to ruby-vips, which is (along with maybe php, I guess) one of the few language bindings maintained by the author of libvips, which should become the defacto image processing manipulation library.

About the C-extensions, I'd be curious on what it takes to build extensions using C, and a study around how nokogiri solved the yearlong issue of install-then-compile by shipping arch-based precompiled binaries, and how this should become more of a standard in the ruby community for gems requiring extensions.

I'll toss out a category - front end automation and web scraping. Is selenium / chromedriver still the king, or is ferrum the new king?
