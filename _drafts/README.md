# Drafts   -   Your Write-Ups Welcome

## Q: Are there any examples for write-ups?

**A:**  For examples see all the 25+ write-ups from the advent calendar 2020 
in the [`../2020`](../2020) folder / directory or 
see the 10+ (older write-ups) from the gems of the week series
in the [`../week`](../week) folder / directory.
Every file in markdown is a write-up / article /post.


## Q: Where can I put the write-up in? Is there a special folder?

**A:**  If you send a pull request it would be great (the best) 
in the `_drafts` folder / directory (that is possible anytime).
