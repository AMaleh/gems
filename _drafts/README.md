**Q: Is there an example for a write up?**

A:  For examples see all the 25+ write-ups from the advent calendar 2020 
in the <../2020> folder / directory or 
see the 10+ (older write-ups) from the gems of the week series
in the <../week> folder / directory.
Every file in markdown is a write-up / article /post.
