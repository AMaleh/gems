## What's Slide Show (S9)?

A Ruby gem that lets you create slide shows and author slides in plain text
using a wiki-style markup language that's easy-to-write and easy-to-read.
The Slide Show (S9) project also collects and welcomes themes
and ships "out-of-the-gem" with built-in support for "loss-free" gradient vector graphics themes.

## Getting Started in 1-2-3 Easy Steps

* Step 1: Author your slides in plain text using a wiki-style markup language
* Step 2: Build your slide show using the `slideshow` gem
* Step 3: Open up your slide show (web page) in your browser and hit the space bar to flip through your slides
* That's it. Showtime!
