## What's Crypto Quotes?


The [cryptoquotes gem](https://github.com/rubycoco/blockchain/tree/master/cryptoquotes) includes the oracle command line tool that gets you a free
random crypto quote of the day on the new new "in math we trust" ponzi economics - on get-rich-quick blockchain secrets - on bitcon maximalists, scammers, morons, clowns, shills & bagHODLers and more


Try the `oracle` command line tool:

```
$ oracle -h
```

resulting in:

```
Usage: oracle [options]
  Print wise oracle sayings / crypto quotes

  Options:
    -n, --number=NUM                 Number of quotes to print (default: 1)
    -h, --help                       Prints this help
```


Let's give it a try. Ask the oracle (it's free):

```
$ oracle
```

printing:

```
We have not entered "Post Tether" yet.
Tether is still furiously printing digital bucks.
Who believes Bitcoin's price is organic?
It's not - it's a Ponzi, and Tether is its Little Helper.

> Austrian Maximalist comments:
>
> Bitcoin is not a ponzi. It is a monetary network, first of its kind.
> Currently valued at 365 billion dollars. What am I missing?

    - Amy Castor
```

Or lets try:

```
$ oracle -n2
```

printing:

```
A friend of mine, who works in finance, asked me to explain what Tether was.

Short version: Tether is the internal accounting system for
the largest fraud since Madoff's ponzi scheme.

Right now at the all-time high (ATH) no one who has HODL is down. That's a good feeling.

I HODL, you HODL, we HODL!

If you want to get quotes in the source format
(in memory)
use the methods from `Quotes`. Example:

```
q = Quotes.random      # get a random quote (as as hash table)
#=> {"quote"=>
#   "Tether is \"too big to fail\" - the entire crypto industry utterly\n" +
#   "depends on it. We just topped twenty billion alleged dollars' worth of tethers ($USDT).\n" +
#   "If you think this is sustainable, you're a fool.\n",
#  "date"=>#<Date: 2020-12-13>,
#  "source"=>"https://twitter.com/davidgerard/status/1338215299737407490",
#  "by"=>"David Gerard"}
```

That's it for now.
